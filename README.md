# Stock Trend Prediction

To run the model you first need to install the following packages:

- matplotlib
- numpy
- pandas
- sklearn
- alpha_vantage
- jupyter

All the packages are available using pip, you can either install the packages manually yourselves or use the requirements.txt file as:

pip install -r requirements.txt

You also need to install PyTorch. Follow the instructions on https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/ for your OS and platform to do so.

I recommend setting up a virtual environment to install all these required packages and running the jupyter notebook inside the environment.
